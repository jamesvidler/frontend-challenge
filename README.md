# Frontend Developer Challenge
Show us your frontend skills with this developer challenge.

We are looking for frontend developers who embrace modern technologies such as JavaScript ES6, NPM, React, VueJS, Angular, Webpack, etc.

## The Challenge
Build an SPA (Single-Page-Application) that allows website visitors to submit a comment and view a listing of **Comments**. (Think  a super-simple version of Twitter).

## Requirements
1. The homepage should have a listing of **Comments** retreived from an external API.
2. The homepage should have a link that allows users to submit a new **Comment**. This can be either to another page or trigger a UI interaction on the current page.
3. When a new **Comment** is submitted, it is displayed at the top of the listing of comments.
4. Design and UI of the SPA is entirely up to you.

## Technology Stack
- 100% Client-side website using either **React**, **VueJS**, or **Angular**.

## Submission
Once you are satisfied, please ensure you create a GitHub repo, with an appropriate README.MD file to run your project and the repo URL via email to your contact at Agility.

## Evaluation
You will be evaluated on the following:
- Demonstration of modern JS concepts such as using ES6, using a Package Manager with JS libraries, and module bundlers
- You met the basic requirements
- The quality of your code
- Ability to document your GitHub Repo and website effectively
- Look and feel of your UI
- Creativity of the solution
